1. Standard - General Purpose
2. Standard - Infrequent Access (IA)
3. One Zone - Infrequent Access (OZ-IA)
   
4. Glacier - Instant retrieval
5. Glacier - Flexible Retrieval
6. Glacier - Deep Archive
   
7. Intelligent tiering

**S3 Lifecycle configuration** helps us automatically move the objects across the various storage classes.

#cloud-question How is S3 Lifecycle Configuration different from Intelligent Tiering ?

### Durability 
- S3 offers **11 9's Durability** of Objects across multiple AZs
- If you store 10,000,000 objects with S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
- This **applies across all storage classes**

### Availability
- Measures how readily available a service is
- **Varies depending on storage class**
- S3 has a 99.99% availability ( **Yearly:** 52m 9.8s of Downtime )
- https://uptime.is/ - to calculate availability

### Standard - General Purpose
- Can sustain 2 concurrent facility failures 
- Big Data analytics, mobile and gaming applications, CDN

### Infrequent access
- Requires rapid access when needed
- Lower cost on storage but cost on retrieval

#### Standard IA
- Disaster recovery and backups ( multi zone )
- 99.9% availability (- **Yearly:** 8h 41m 38s Downtime )

#### One Zone IA
- High Durability (9-9's Durability) in a single AZ
- Data lost if AZ is destroyed
- Availability ( 99.5% - **Yearly:** 1d 19h Downtime )
- Storing secondary backup copies of on prem data, re-creatable data

### Glacier 
- Low cost meant for archiving / back up
- Pricing : Storage + Object retrieval cost

#### Glacier Instant Retrieval
- **Millisecond** retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
- Minimum storage of 90 days

#### Glacier Flexible Retrieval
- **Expedited** ( 1 to 5 minutes ) ( Closer to Glacier IR )
- **Standard** ( 3 to 5 hours )
- **Bulk** ( 5 to 12 hours ) ( Free )
- Minimum storage duration of 90 days

#### Glacier Deep Archive - Long term storage
- **Standard** ( 12 hours )
- Bulk ( 48 hours )
- Minimum storage duration (180 days ~ 6 months )



### Intelligent Tiering
**No retrieval charges !**
- Small monthly fee for monitoring and auto-tiering
- Moves objects automatically between tiers based on usage
- No retrieval charges



### Lifecycle Rules

**Transition Actions** : Configure objects to transition to another storage class 

**Expiration Actions** : Configure objects to expire after some time
- Access logs can be set to delete after 365 days
- Can be used to delete old versions if versioning is enabled
- Can be used to delete incomplete Multi-Part uploads

> Rules can be created for a specific Prefix
> Rules can be created for certain object Tags as well


### Scenario:

A rule in your company states that you should be able to 

1. recover deleted S3 objects **immediately** for up to 30 days 2. Immediate access would happen rarely
2. After this time, for the next 1 year deleted objects should be recoverable within 48 hours

Solution: 
1. Enable versioning on the bucket 
2. Enable rule to move "non concurrent" versions of the object keep them in standard (IA) infrequent access tier for 30 days
3. Move them to glacier deep archive after 30 days 
4. Set expiration date to 365 days after moving to Glacier Deep Archive

### S3 Analytics for Storage Class and Lifecycle Rules analysis

- Helps decide when to transition objects to the right storage class
- Works with Standard and Standard IA 
- **Does NOT WORK for One Zone IA and Glacier**
- Takes 24 - 48 hours to start seeing analysis reports
