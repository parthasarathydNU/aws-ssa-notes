### User-Based
- IAM Policies - Which API calls should be allowed for a specific user from IAM
### Resource Based
- Bucket Policies - bucket wide rules from the S3 console - allows cross account access ( users from other accounts to access S3 bucket )
- Object Access Control List - To provide fine grained access policies to individual objects
- Bucket access control List ( ACL ) - Les common ( can be disabled )

### Encryption
- An important feature of all cloud resources are encryption  - we can encrypt all objects uploaded to S3, that was it can only be accessed if decrypted through the key management service 

### Bucket Policies 

S3 uses JSON based policies and each one is a JSON document the looks like this ![[Pasted image 20240425144542.png]]

### Policy Document Breakdown

### Resource Block : 
Which resources does this policy act on - in the above example, this policy acts on the example bucket. 

- Resources follow the following format:
	-`arn : partition: service : region : account_id: ( resource_type ): resource id`

In the above example we have  : `arn:aws:s3: : : examplebucket/*  This points to all objects under the bucket `exampleBucket`. 

### Principles: 
The AMI users who have access to the resource. I the above example, we have * as the principle which implies that it is accessible by all. 

### Effect: 
Either allow or deny the principal access to the resource. [“Allow”, “Deny”].

### Actions
The list of actions that the principle has access to on the resources mentioned in the policy

### Use cases of S3 bucket policy
1. Grant public access to a bucket
2. To force objects to be encrypted at upload
3. Grant access to another account ( **Cross Account** )

1. Allow public access policy on the bucket![[Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 10.23.09 AM.png]]
2. Give user role / IAM policy to access S3 bucket objects![[Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 10.24.47 AM.png]]
3. Give EC2 instances IAM Permission to access S3 bucket contents ![[Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 10.25.19 AM.png]]
4. Give IAM users in another AWS account access to S3 bucket by setting bucket policy ![[Screenshot 2024-04-28 at 10.32.48 AM.png]]
