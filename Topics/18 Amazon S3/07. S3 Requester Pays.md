By default, bucket owners pay for all Amazon S3 storage and data transfer costs associated with the bucket

With the **Requester Pays bucket** option enabled, the requester pays for the Networking cost associated with the data transfer from the bucket. This is very helpful when you want to share large amounts of data with multiple AWS accounts. To enable this feature, the requester cannot be anonymous, they must be an authenticated AWS user
