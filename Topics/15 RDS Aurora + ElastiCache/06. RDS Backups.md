Useful for data loss

### Automated

1. Daily automated full db backup during backup window
2. Transaction logs are backed up by RDS every 5 minutes
   => We can lose data that was processed until the last 5th minute
   => Not suitable for applications that have higher frequency of data processing
3. 1 - 35 days of backup retention (optional, can be disabled)

### Manual 
1. No expiration date for manual DB snapshots

### Trick

When and how to use the RDS backup: Suppose we only want to use the database for 2 hours in a week / month. 

Stopping the database during the remaining hours is still going to cost us money. So the more cost effective strategy is to take a snapshot of the database , delete it and restore it from the snapshot whenever it is needed again.
