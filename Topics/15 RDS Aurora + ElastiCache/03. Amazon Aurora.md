Proprietary technology by AWS (not open sourced) and is compatible for applications that use a MySQL or a PostgreSQL driver.  RDBMS Data base

### Claims: 
- Aurora is AWS *"cloud optimized"* and claims 5x **performance improvement** **over** MySQL on **RDS** and over 3x performance of Postgres on RDS
- Automatically grows in increments of 10GB up to **128 TB** in size - Grow without manual intervention 
- Can have up to 15 Read replicas and the **replication process is faster than MySQL** (sub 10ms replica lag)
- Failover is **instantaneous** as compared **multi AZ on RDS**
- Since it is cloud native, it is highly available
- Costs 20% more than RDS - higher savings when implemented in scale

### High Avail and Read Scaling
- High Availability is by default pre built when using Aurora
- 6 copies of data **across 3 AZ**
	- 4 copies of 6 are set for writes and ( 1 must be the primary )
	- 3 copies out of 6 are set for reads
	- it has an inbuilt self healing capacity for corrupted transactions, using peer-to-peer replication
	- Storage is stripped across 100s of volumes
- One master for writes
- Automated failover for master in less than 30 seconds
  There is no stand by in this case, like in RDS, one of the Read Replicas becomes the Master.
- Support for cross region replication

### Summary
1 master
multiple read replicas
Storage is replicated, self healing, auto expanding by blocks
