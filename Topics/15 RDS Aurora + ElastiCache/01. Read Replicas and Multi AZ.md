Help us to scale our reads. 
- We can create up to 15 read replicas
- Within AZ, cross AZ or cross Region

Async Replication across read replicas. This follows the eventual consistency model. 

Each of these read replicas can also be promoted to become a separate database which will have it's own lifecycle. 

To leverage this feature, the application has to configure itself to access all available read replicas on it's end.

### Use case

### Networking costs for Read Replicas

In AWS there's a network cost when data goes from one AZ to another. 

However there are exceptions for managed services. 
- For RDS read replicas, within the same region, we don't pay a fee
- We pay replication fee if we perform replication across regions.

### Multi AZ (Disaster Recovery)

#cloud-important #aws-ssa-important

RDS provisions a stand by database if we enable this option for automatic failover
- Synchronous replication between primary and standby
- Automatic failover without any changes from client side
- Increased availability
- This is not for scaling or to be used as a read replica, this will be hidden from all other services until the primary fails

Question for exam: 
Can read replicas be set across multiple AZs for better disaster recovery ? Yes

### How can we upgrade an RDS database from single AZ to multi AZ for disaster recovery ?

Apart from having replicas across AZs, we can also have a standby set up in another AZ
- It is a 0 downtime operation
- Click on modify and enable multi AZ

#### How does this happen : 
1. A snapshot is taken 
2. A new DB is restored from the snapshot in a new AZ
3. Synchronization is established between the two databases
