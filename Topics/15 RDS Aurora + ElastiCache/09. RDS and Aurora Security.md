Data is encrypted on the volume. 
1. Master and replicas are encrypted using AWS KMS and this must be defined during launch time. 
2. If Master is not encrypted, then read replicas are not encrypted. 
3. If we have to encrypt and un encrypted database, we will have to take a snapshot, and restore it as a new encrypted database.
