### Security
- Supports IAM auth for **REDIS** only!
- **IAM policies** on ElastiCache are only at the AWS API level, we can further set a password / token based access to the Redis Cluster for higher security
- Redis supports SSL in flight encryption

### Patterns for using Elasticache

**Lazy loading into cache** : First try to read from cache, but if the data is not there load data into cache from DB. 
Data in cache can become stale, this is where cache invalidation comes into the picture

**Write through** : Whenever we write any entry to the DB we also write it to the cache so that the cache is up to date. We also need to check if cache is stale or up to date

**Session Store** : Store temp session data in cache with time to live features

*There are only two hard things in computer science - Cache Invalidation and Naming things*

### ElastiCache Use cases for Redis

**REDIS Sorted Sets**
- This is an inbuilt feature in Elasticache Redis, which guarantees both uniqueness and element ordering. 
- Each time a new element is added, it is ranked in real time and then added in the correct order to the cache. 

This can be a use case for gaming leaderboards where at every second we want to know who is at the top. So instead of worrying about writing this application logic externally, it will automatically happen within the redis cluster when we write an entry.  ![[Screenshot 2024-04-03 at 12.50.47 PM.png]]
