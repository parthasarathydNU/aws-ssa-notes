Get managed Redis or Memcache D

Caches : In memory database with very high performance and low latency

How does a cache help ? 
- Reduce load off of a database for read intensive work loads. 
- Common queries are going to be cached and db isn't queried every time. 
- This helps the application become stateless as we can. now put the state of the application onto the cache 
### Note : !!!!
Enabling Elasticache involved heavy application level code changes. Because this will involve querying the cache before or after querying the database. 


### Architecture 1 To use Cache Technologies

**A cache invalidation strategy must be put in place for the above strategy to work well!**

### Use Case 2 : Writing User Session Data to Cache

This way users can be redirected to any instance of our application and still have the same state of their application. 

#### A question here:
What happened to storing user session data in the browser ? ![[Screenshot 2024-04-02 at 9.59.00 PM.png]]

If the browser crashes, then the user session data is lost, so it is not a great idea to store user session data in cache also it could lead to security concerns in the longer run.
