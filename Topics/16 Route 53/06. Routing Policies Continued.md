### Failover (Active - Passive)

When we have a primary and a backup EC2 instance. When the health check of the primary instance fails, Route 53 can be configured to automatically switch the traffic to the back up instance as a failover mechanism.

### Geo Location

This is different from Latency Based and here it focusses more on where the user is actually located. 

- We can specify location by Continent, Country or by US State. 
- Should create a Default Record (in case there is no match on location)
- This use case, is for app localization, restrict content distribution , load balancing etc..

For example if the user is from within the country of France, redirect that user to the French version of the app, if they are in Germany, redirect them to the German Version and by default redirect them to the English Version of the app. ![[Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 12.00.30 PM.png]]

### Geo Proximity Routing policy

Route traffic based on user location and resources. 

How is this different from Latency ?

Depending on the size of a geographic location, we specify a bias value. 
- To expand ( 1 to  99 ) - more traffic to resource
- To shrink ( -1 to -99 ) - less traffic to the resource

This policy can be assigned to both AWS, non AWS and on-prem resources. 

For AWS resources, we need to specify the region so AWS can compute the best routing 

For non AWS resources, we need to specify the lat and longitude of the resource for AWS to compute the best geo proximity routing.

The Advanced Route 53 traffic flow should be enabled to leverage this feature.

#### Why do we do this ? 
#aws-ssa-important
If we want to shift more traffic to a specific region, we can use geo proximity routing policy and set bias values to each target of the routing policy.

### IP based routing Policy

Redirect network traffic to different targets based on the client's IP address. 

#### Use case : When we have a specific set of CIRD blocks that we know belongs to certain clients

This way, when the request comes from a client from org 1 we know what are the specific resources that we need to allocate to them, so we can redirect them to a different environment  vs a client from org 2 who needs different content and resources, they can still be given the same url to access the application. ![[Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 12.19.18 PM.png]]

### Multi Value Routing

Use case - when we want to route traffic to multiple resources.  ?? 
- Can be associated with health checks and ensure that only values for healthy resources are returned. 
- Up to 8 healthy records are returned for each Multi-Value Query
- It is more like client side load balancing.

Like we see in the above example image, we have multiple targets for the same domain name. If we set the routing policy to multiple value, all the healthy targets form the configured list of targets will be returned. It is then the responsibility of the client to decide which target to send the request to.

This is different from the Simple Routing Policy in the sense that, in Simple Routing Policy, when we return multiple values, we are not sure if those targets are healthy or not. But in case of multi value routing, we can be sure that all the returned target values are healthy, because Route 53 filters out only the healthy targets based on health checks.
