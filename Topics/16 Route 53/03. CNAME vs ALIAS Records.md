AWS resources expose a AWS host name. Example l`b1-1234.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com`

But we want to give it a different name like `myapp.domain.com`

How do we achieve this ?
### CNAME:
- Points a hostname to any other host name:
- For example: pointing `app.mydomain.com` to `blabla.anything.com`
- Only works if we have a non root domain name and not for root domain names like `mydomain.com`, it has to be `something.mydomain.com`
Does not work for the zone APEX
### Alias
- Points a hostname to an AWS resource
- Example ; `app.mydomain.com` => blabla.amazonaws.com
- #aws-ssa-important**Works for both root and non root domain!** (root domains are called the Zone **Apex**)
- Free of charge and have native health check capabilities
- Native health check capability within them
- Only mapped to resources in AWS
- Alias records are always for resources and are type A or AAAA
Works for the Zone APEX

## We cannot set an ALIAS record for an EC2 DNS name!

Apart form EC2 DNS names, the target for an ALIAS record can be other resources in AWS that have DNS names such as the following![[Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 1.44.54 PM.png]]
