### 4 Types of Load Balancers

1. Classic Load Balancer (CLB) (v1 - old generation) supports HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL
2. Application Load Balancer (ALB) (v2 - new gen) supports HTTP, HTTPS, WebSocket
3. Network Load Balancer (NLB) (v2 - new gen) supports TCP, TLS, UDP
4. Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB) (Operates at layer 3 Network Layer) - IP protocol 

Load balancers can also be set up as private / public depending on which traffic we want it to route.

When we setup EC2 instances behind load balancers, we need to set up a firewall that only allows requests from the load balancer to the EC2 instance.

### Application Load Balancer

Only a layer 7 load balancer - Application Level

"Choose an Application Load Balancer when you need a flexible feature set for your applications with HTTP and HTTPS traffic. Operating at the request level, Application Load Balancers provide advanced routing and visibility features targeted at application architectures, including microservices and containers."

Features:
- Balancing to multiple applications across machines
- Balancing load to multiple applications (containers) on the same machine !
- Support for HTTP2 and web sockets
- Redirects from http to https can be performed here
- Routing based on path in URL (example.com`/users`, ex.com`/posts`)!
- Routing based on hostname (`one.example.com`, `other.example.com`)!
- This is pretty interesting
- Routing based on Query String and Headers !
  example.com/users? `id=123&order=false`

This way we can just have one entry point into our application and control the traffic from there.

ALB are a great it for micro services & container based apps (Docker and ECS)

Has port mapping feature to direct traffic to a dynamic port on the Elastic Container Service.

In the above image we see how the ALB is able to route traffic to different `Target Groups` based on the route URL.




### Other Load Balancers

"Choose a Network Load Balancer when you need ultra-high performance, TLS offloading at scale, centralized certificate deployment, support for UDP, and static IP addresses for your applications. Operating at the connection level, **Network Load Balancers are capable of handling millions of requests per second securely while maintaining ultra-low latencies."**

"Choose a Gateway Load Balancer when you need to deploy and manage a fleet of third-party virtual appliances that support GENEVE. These appliances enable you to improve security, compliance, and policy controls."
