MIGs in Google Cloud ( Managed Instance Groups )

- Scale in and Scale out based on load. 
- Set params to define min and max number of instances running at any given time

Additional super power, if we pair up an ASG with a load balancer, any EC2 instance linked to the ASG will also be now connected to the load balancer. 

If one instance is deemed unhealthy, it is terminated and a new instance is created to replace it. 

**Cost** : ASG do not cost extra, it is only the cost of the resources that w use behind the ASG. 
### Attributes
1. Launch Template - information on how to launch EC2 instances within ASG ( AMI, Instance Type, User Data, Volumes, SGs, IAM Roles, Network + Subnets, ...)
   
   These are the params that we provide when creating the actual instances - it is the same thing, now instead of creating we are just defining the aprameters in which we watn to create

2. Min / Max size / Initial Capacity

3. Scaling policies


Cloud Watch Alarm can be paired with the ASG, it can trigger scaling activities on the ASG. 

The alarm monitors various metrics and we can set scale out and scale in policies. 

### Scaling Policies

#### Dynamic Scaling
- Target Tracking Scalign
	- Set a target metric for the ASG to monitor Eg: I want the avg CPU useage to stay around 40%
	- When we set this, the ASG will bring units up or down i order to  keep the avertage CPIU usage to 40%
- Simple / Step Scaling
	- Scale in steps of one or two when the CLU usage goes above a certain limit or falls below a certain limit

#### Scheduled Scaling
- Anticipate loads based on user usage patterns

#### Predictive scaling
- Using known patterns in usage data  to predict usage and scale accordingly

### Good metrics to scale on

1. CPU utilization : Average CPU utilization across instances
2. Request count per Target: To make sure the number of requests per EC2 instances is stable
3. Average Network In / Out (if application is network bound like uploads / downloads)
4. Any custom metric

### Scaling Cool Downs

After any scaling activity happens, we enter into a scaling cooldown period - default is 300 seconds

During this period AutoScalingGroup will not launch or terminate additional instances - to allow metrics to stabilize

This is where a fully configurable AMI will help, if our AMI is fully configured, and ready to be deployed and implemented, it will help us reduce our cooldown period and have a more dynamic response to varying loads.
