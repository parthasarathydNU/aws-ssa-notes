- Layer 4 Load balancer for TCP and UDP traffic. 
- Really really high performance
- Millions of requests per second
- Less latency as compared to ALB

NLB has one static IP per AZ and supports assigning Elastic IP (static IP) for Each AZ.

"An _Elastic IP address_ is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is allocated to your AWS account, and is yours until you release it. By using an Elastic IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in your account. Alternatively, you can specify the Elastic IP address in a DNS record for your domain, so that your domain points to your instance."

#cloud-important This is important when we want to expose our application with a given set of static IPs and this can be Elastic IPs.

So in the exam if we get a question that has something along the lines of "your application should only be accessible by one two or three different IPs and they have to be whitelisted", we should think about the network load balancer as an option.

Not included in the AWS free tier.

### Target Groups
- EC2 Instances
- Hardcoded private IP addresses - EC2 instance or onPrem server
- It is also possible to have a NLB in front of ALB
- Health checks performed by the NLB for the target groups support 3 different kinds of protocols - TCP, HTTP and HTTPS Protocols


What's the difference between having a Network Load Balancer and a NAT gateway ?
