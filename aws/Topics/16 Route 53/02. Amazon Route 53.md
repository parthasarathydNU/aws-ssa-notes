Highly Available, scalable, fully managed and Authoritative DNS. 

Authoritative means the customer can update the DNS record. Like we did for our assignments. 

The authoritative record will only be available in the name server. In our assignment, we set the name server to the ones provided by google cloud through our publicly hosted DNS zone. And we add the public IP of our resources to this DNS zone. 

Further Route 53 is also a registrar so we can buy new domain names. 

53 is a reference to the traditional DNS port used by DNS servers. 

### Important Record Types

- A - maps a host name to a IPv4 IP
- AAAA - maps a hostname to an IPv6 address
- CNAME - maps a hostname into another host name
	- The target domain name must have a A or AAAA record
- NS - name servers of the hosted zone

### Hosted Zone
- A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and it's sub domains. 

**Public Hosted Zone** : contains records that specify how to route traffic on the Internet ( public exposed domain names)

**Private Hosted Zones:** Records that specify how you route traffic within one or more VPCs for ( private domain names )

### TTL

Time to Live

#### High TTL:
For example 24 hours, 
- The record is cached for 24 hours in DNS servers
- So if there is any change in the record, it will not be immediately reflected to the other DNS servers that cache this record
- Lesser requests will reach this DNS server (Route 53) because they are cached for longer in the various DNS servers

### Low TTL: 
For example 60sec
- The record is cached only for 60 seconds in DNS servers
- Any change in a record is immediately propagated to other DNS servers once the 60 second window expires
- More work for the DNS server, because every 60 seconds Domain Name Look up requests will reach the name server
- Higher cost because more work done by the DNS server. 

TTL is mandatory for every record except the Alias Record

If we plan on changing the record, we first decrease the TTL for 24 hours, and we are sure than all the different DNS servers have received the lower TTL value , we then update the record so that this is propagated quickly to all DNS servers.
