Defines the way how route 53 responds to DNS queries. 

Route 53 supports the following routing policy: 
- Simple
- Weighted
- Failover
- .......
- ....
- ..

### Simple Routing Policy

Typically to Route traffic to a single resource.
- There is possibility to specify multiple A records for a single domain name. 
- In that case, the client is free to pick which domain name to go ahed with. 
- Instead of IP address if we use an ALIAS, then for simple routing policy we can only use one AWS resource as the ALIAS target.

**No Health checks available for this routing policy**

There is also the **option to return multiple IP values** as part of the Simple Routing Policy![[Screenshot 2024-04-04 at 2.01.35 PM.png]]

### Weighted Routing Policy

We can have a percentage of requests that we can control to go to a particular resource. 

Percentage of requests sent to a particular target is defined by 
**traffic(%) = (weight of record) / (sum of weight of all records)**

**Can be associated with health checks.** 
#### Use case: 
- Load balancing between regions
- AB Testing to a small group of users

Assign the weight of 0 to a resource and traffic will not be sent to that resource. But if all resources are set to 0, then traffic will be equally distributed. 

### Latency Based Routing Policy

Redirect to the resource that has the lowest latency amongst the available resources. 

Latency is based on traffic between users and AWS regions. 

**Can be combined with Health Checks**

Route 53 picks the resource that has the lowest latency with respect to the network of the client.
