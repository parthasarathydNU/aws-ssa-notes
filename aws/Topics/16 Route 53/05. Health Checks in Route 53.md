A way to check the health of resources. Mainly public resources. 

When we have multiple A records for a given domain name and when we use routing policies like Weighted or latency, if one of the resources is down, we don't want to be sending requests to those resources even if they pass the checks of our routing policy. 

So do avoid this, we create health checks from Route 53 to each of the record . This way we have automated DNS failover. 

## Monitoring an End Point

**About 15 global health checkers will check our end point.** 

We can set up the various attributes of the health check such as 
- Healthy/Unhealthy Threshold
- Interval
- Supported Protocols are HTTP, HTTPS and TCP

If > 18% of the health checkers report the end point as healthy, Route 53 will consider it as healthy, else it is deemed as unhealthy. 

### Status Codes

Only if we get back 2xx or 3xx status codes from the end points.

#aws-ssa-important
Or if we have a text based response, the health check can pass / fail based on the first **5120 bytes** of the response 

**We have to configure firewall to allow incoming requests form route 53 IP address range** which is a publicly documented ip address range.

## Calculated Health Checks

To combine results of multiple health checks in to a single health check. 

We can use boolean logic to calculate the parent health check value. **OR, AND, NOT**

We can monitor up to 256 Child Health Checks and specify how many of the health checks have to pass if the parent has to pass. 

### **What is the use case of Calculated Health Checks ?** 

------------------------------------------
In Route 53, you can create a calculated health check, which indeed allows you to combine the health status of up to 256 child health checks into a single parent health check. However, the purpose and functionality of this feature are a bit more nuanced:

1. **Calculated Health Checks**: This feature in Route 53 allows you to create a parent health check that determines its health by aggregating the status of other (child) health checks. You can set rules on how the statuses of these child health checks influence the parent's health. For instance, you might configure the parent health check to be considered unhealthy if any one of its children is unhealthy.

2. **Use Cases**: This is particularly useful for complex architectures where the health of a service depends on multiple components. For example, if your application's availability relies on several microservices, each with its own health check, a calculated health check can provide a top-level view of the application's health based on the aggregated health status of all these microservices.

3. **Configuration**: When you create a calculated health check, you specify the child health checks and define the criteria for determining the parent's health. For example, you might say the parent health check is unhealthy if at least X number of child health checks are unhealthy.

4. **Limitations**: While you can associate up to 256 child health checks with a single calculated health check, it's essential to design your health check architecture thoughtfully to ensure it accurately represents the system's health and doesn't cause unnecessary complexity or confusion.

5. **Application**: Calculated health checks are beneficial for high-level health monitoring and decision-making in DNS failover configurations. By aggregating the health status of various components, Route 53 can make more informed routing decisions, improving the availability and reliability of your applications.

In summary, calculated health checks in Route 53 allow for a comprehensive and customizable approach to monitoring the health of complex architectures by aggregating multiple child health checks into a single, overarching health status. This mechanism is vital for maintaining high availability and ensuring that traffic is only routed to healthy endpoints.

### Monitoring Health of a private resource

All the Route 53 Health Checks live on the internet and they are outside VPCs. So they cannot access private end points. 

The way to achieve this is to Create a Cloud Watch Metric, and Associate a Cloud Watch Alarm with it. Then Create a health check that checks the alarm itself. 

When the alarm goes into the alarm state, the health check will automatically switch to unhealthy. ![[Screenshot 2024-04-05 at 11.44.13 AM.png]]
