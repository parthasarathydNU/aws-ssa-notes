In-memory data caching systems
### Redis 
Optional Durability: can be configured to write data to disk at specified intervals or append each command to a log providing a level of persistence. 
- **Multi AZ** with auto failover
- Read replicas **available**
- Data **Durability**
- **Backup** and **Restore** Feature
- Supports sets and sorted sets

### MemcacheD
Purely memory based and does not write data to Disk
- No replication
- Not persistent
- No backup / restore
- Multi threaded architecture 
- Multi-node for partitioning ( sharding )


## Summary
1. Redis is for high availability, back up read replicas etc..
2. Memcache is for a pure caching solution where we can afford to lose data, no high availability or durability
