#### Writer End Point
Since in Aurora, the master can fail and any of the Read Replicas can take over, Aurora provides a Writer End Point. This is a DNS name that will always point to the right instance. 

We can also set up Auto Scaling on the Read Replicas such that we have the right number of read replicas. 

We have a **Reader End Point** - is a like a Network Load Balancer or more like a Connection Load Balancer. When connecting to the Reader End point, the client is redirected to one of the underlying read replicas for read requests.
