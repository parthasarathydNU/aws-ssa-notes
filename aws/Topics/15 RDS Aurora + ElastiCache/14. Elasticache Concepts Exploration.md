#### I was reading about MemcacheD and Redis and learnt that Memcached has no durability, availablity or data persistence when compared to redis.

That's correct. Memcached and Redis are both popular in-memory data caching systems, but they have different characteristics and are suited to different use cases. Here's a comparison highlighting the differences you mentioned regarding durability, availability, and data persistence:

1. **Durability**:
   - **Memcached**: It doesn't offer data durability. When Memcached is restarted or crashes, all the data stored in it is lost. This is because Memcached is purely memory-based and does not write data to disk.
   - **Redis**: Offers optional durability. Redis can be configured to write data to disk at specified intervals or append each command to a log, providing a level of data persistence. This allows Redis to recover stored data after a restart or crash.

2. **Availability**:
   - **Memcached**: It doesn't have built-in high availability features. To achieve high availability with Memcached, you would need to implement additional strategies or architectures, like replication or consistent hashing, at the application level.
   - **Redis**: Supports built-in replication features, allowing it to be used in a master-slave setup. This enhances availability since slaves can take over in case the master fails. Moreover, Redis Sentinel provides high availability through monitoring, notification, and automatic failover.

3. **Data Persistence**:
   - **Memcached**: Does not support data persistence. It is designed to be a transient cache where data can be lost without significant consequences. The primary use case for Memcached is to cache non-durable data, such as session information or temporary computations.
   - **Redis**: Supports data persistence through two methods: RDB (Redis Database Backup) snapshots and AOF (Append Only File) logging. This means that Redis can be used not just as a cache but also as a data store for durable data.

In summary, Redis offers more features concerning data durability, availability, and persistence compared to Memcached, which is simpler and often faster due to its focus on being a lightweight caching solution without the overhead of additional features. The choice between Memcached and Redis will depend on the specific requirements of your application, particularly concerning the need for data durability and high availability.

#### In elasticache cluter mode (AWS) when it says that data is stored across multiple shards. Do these shards also have backups / replicas taken for higher availability across AZs ?

Yes, in Amazon ElastiCache for Redis cluster mode, data is partitioned across multiple shards, and each shard can have one primary node and zero or more replica nodes. These replicas can be used to enhance availability, particularly across different Availability Zones (AZs).

When you enable cluster mode in Amazon ElastiCache for Redis, you can specify the number of replicas you want for each shard. By placing these replicas in different AZs, you can ensure that your cache remains available even if one AZ goes down. Here's how it works:

1. **Sharding**: Sharding distributes data across multiple nodes (or shards), enabling the dataset to grow beyond the capacity of a single node and increasing throughput because operations can be parallelized across shards.

2. **Replication**: Each shard can have replicas, which are copies of the primary node in that shard. If the primary node fails, one of the replicas can be promoted to be the new primary, minimizing downtime and maintaining data access.

3. **Multi-AZ with Auto-Failover**: You can configure ElastiCache to automatically detect the failure of a primary node and promote a replica to primary status, ensuring that the system remains operational. If these replicas are placed in different AZs, you can protect your application against the failure of a single location.

4. **Backup and Restore**: While replication is primarily about maintaining high availability, ElastiCache also allows you to back up your Redis cluster. You can take snapshots of your Redis cluster, which can be stored in Amazon S3 and used for recovery purposes if needed.

By using these features, ElastiCache for Redis ensures that your cache data is not only partitioned for scalability but also replicated for availability, providing a robust solution for applications requiring high performance and reliability.

#### Are these features present in Memcached as well ? 

Amazon ElastiCache supports both Redis and Memcached, but the features related to data partitioning, replication, and high availability differ significantly between the two:

1. **Sharding**:
   - **Memcached**: ElastiCache for Memcached does not support sharding in the same way as Redis. However, you can manually partition your data across multiple Memcached nodes to scale horizontally. This manual partitioning is typically handled at the application level.
   - **Redis**: ElastiCache for Redis supports automatic sharding in cluster mode, where data is automatically partitioned across multiple shards.

2. **Replication and High Availability**:
   - **Memcached**: ElastiCache for Memcached does not support replication or automatic failover. If a Memcached node fails, it's up to the application to handle the failure, and any data stored on that node is lost unless the application has implemented its own redundancy or data persistence mechanism.
   - **Redis**: ElastiCache for Redis supports replication and automatic failover in both standard and cluster modes. You can have multiple replicas for each primary node, and these replicas can be placed in different AZs for higher availability.

3. **Multi-AZ with Auto-Failover**:
   - **Memcached**: There is no built-in support for Multi-AZ deployments with auto-failover in ElastiCache for Memcached. You would need to implement your own strategy for failover and data replication across AZs if necessary.
   - **Redis**: ElastiCache for Redis supports Multi-AZ deployments with auto-failover, enhancing the availability of your cache.

4. **Backup and Restore**:
   - **Memcached**: ElastiCache for Memcached does not offer backup and restore capabilities since it is designed as a purely ephemeral cache.
   - **Redis**: ElastiCache for Redis allows you to take backups of your data and restore from backups, which is useful for disaster recovery and data persistence.

In summary, while ElastiCache provides robust scalability and high availability features for Redis, the service's support for Memcached is more basic, focusing on its strengths as a simple, high-performance, in-memory caching solution without built-in data durability or failover capabilities.
