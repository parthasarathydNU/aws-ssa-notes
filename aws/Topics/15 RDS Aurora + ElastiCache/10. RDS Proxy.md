Tell me about RDS Proxy

- If there are multiple clients that want to connect to the database, the RDS proxy will pool all those connections into less number of connections to the RDS database. 
- This helps with better utilization of resources on the DB server by reducing stress on DB resources and minimize open connections and connection timeouts. 
- Proxy is fully server less, auto scaling and is highly available across multiple AZs. 
- Since clients only connect to the Proxy, if there is any failover on the RDS DB instance, it is handled internally and there is nothing that the clients need to do about this. 
- RDS Proxy supports RDS and Amazon Aurora. 

So the client instead of connection to RDS or Aurora database, they can just connect to the RDS proxy and they will be good to go. 

RDS proxy is never publicly available hence it has to be within the VPC allowing for enhanced security controls. 

We can further enforce IAM authentication and security groups on the RDS proxy so only select user's service accounts can access the underlying DB through proxy.

#### Use case RDS proxy

Suppose we have a situation where we have a lambda function connected to an RDS database.  In case the lambda function spawns up to 1000s of instances, then the RDS instance will be bombarded with 1000s of connections and might cause stress on the database. This is where RDS proxy comes into the picture, it pools all of the 1000s lambda connections and passes it to the underlying RDS database without causing timeouts and it kills any remaining open connections. 

### Summary
Minimize and pool connections 
Minimize failover time and reduce it by up to 66%
Enforce IAM authentication for DB
