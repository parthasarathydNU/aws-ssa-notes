### Snapshots
Restoring form snapshot creates a new instance in both Aurora and RDS

### Manual

#### RDS
1. Create a backup of on-prem db
2. Store it in S3
3. Restore form back-up in S3 to a new DB

Aurora
1. Create a backup of on-prem DB using Percona XtraBackup
2. ...
3. ....

## Aurora DB cloning

Use case : Suppose you want to create a staging environment for testing and want to mimic prod environment as is, using Aurora DB cloning is the way to go. 

1. Creates a new Aurora DB cluster from an existing one
2. Faster than taking a snapshot and restoring !

This process uses the "Copy - on -write" protocol. That is explained very well in this article. 

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/Aurora.Managing.Clone.html#Aurora.Managing.Clone.Protocol

In this strategy, until there is change in data, both the source and the clone point to the same instance. But whenever there is any change made either from the source, or the clone, a new copy of the data is made which belong to the DB making that change, the data that the other DB points to remains the same. 

This way, production data is not touched and also any number of clones can be created quickly for testing purposes.
