- Enable versioning at **Bucket Level.**
- Uploading objects with the same key will create a new version 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
- Deleting an object in a versioned bucket, will only add a delete marker on top of it

> Any file that was uploaded before versioning was enabled will be marked as a "null" version.

> Suspending versioning does not delete pre created versions.
