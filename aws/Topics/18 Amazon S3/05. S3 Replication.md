### Async Replication

> Cross Region Replication
> Same Region Replication

#### Important Points
1. Buckets can be in different AWS Accounts !
2. Copying is Asyc
3. Proper IAM permissions must be given to S3 service to be able to carry out async replication

### Use cases

#### Cross Region Replication
- Compliance purposes
- Lower latency for geographically distributed users
- Replication across accounts

#### Same region Replication
- For log aggregation
- Live replication between prod and test

## Important

- After setting up replication , **only new objects are replicated**
- **Batch replication** is required to replicate existing objects 
	- Batch Replication replicates objects prior to setting up replication and objects that Failed during live replication
- Can also replicate **delete markers** from source to target, however **targeted deletes** ( delete with version id ) **are not replicated** ?? 
- There is **no chaining of replication**. i.e., if bucket 1 is replicated into bucket 2 and bucket 2 into bucket 3. Contents of bucket one are not directly replicated to bucket 3
- Setting up **batch replication** is a separate process form the replication feature itself
