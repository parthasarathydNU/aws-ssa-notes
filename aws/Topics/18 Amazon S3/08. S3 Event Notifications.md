Trigger events on specific events happening on S3 buckets. 

Examples: If you want to generate a thumbnail for all the images that are being generated on S3.

For Event Notifications to work, we need to enable IAM permissions. 

1. We need to attach an **SNS Resource Access Policy** to the SNS topic to allow the S3 buckets to send messages directly into the SNS topic
2. .. similarly other policies to authorize the S3 service to be able to send the event notification to the required target resource SNS, SQS or Lambda

SNS, SQS and Lambda are some of the existing S3 event targets. But now there is a new integration that has come up.  We have to set up policies at this target to allow S3 service to send messages to them

### Amazon Event Bridge

All S3 event notifications are logged in the Event Bridge service and rules can be set up in the Event Bridge to define where each message has to be directed to do based on filters and the event's content. 

- Filtering options with JSON rules ( metadata, obj size, name )
- Multiple Destinations
- EventBridge Features - Archive events, Replay events and Reliable Delivery
