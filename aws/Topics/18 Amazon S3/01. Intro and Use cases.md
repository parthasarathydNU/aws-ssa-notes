- Data back up + storage
- Archive ( Use archive tier of S3 )
- Application Hosting and hosting Media
- Data lakes and big data analytics

### Buckets
- Can be thought of as directories, while it looks like a folder structure, S3 uses a flat namespace
- Buckets must have a globally unique name ( across all regions and accounts )

> ***While S3 looks like a global service, the buckets that are created in a particular region.*** 

#### Key
All objects in S3 have a key - which is basically the  **Full Path**:
- s3://my-bucket/my-file.txt
- s3://my-bucket/my-folder/another-folder/my-file.txt

#### Prefix 
The key is composed of prefix + file name. In this example:  `s3://my-bucket/my-folder/another-folder/my-file.txt`,  `my-folder/another-folder/` forms the prefix and `my-file.txt` is the file name. 

Anything in between  `s3://my-bucket/` and the **file name** is part of the prefix.

#### Quirks
**Object Values**:
- Max object size is 5TB ( 5000 GB )
- Max file upload size is 5GB - if we were to upload a file larger than 5GB, we need to use the “multi-part-upload” feature

**Metadata**: key/value pairs that can be used to understand about the object stored
**Tags** : Useful for security and lifecycle methods
**Version** : If versioning is included
