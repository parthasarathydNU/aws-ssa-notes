### Two names for this feature
1. Connection Draining
2. De-registration delay

Give some time for our instances to complete active requests while the instance is marked unhealthy. 

While the connection is being drained, the ELB will stop serving requests to that particular EC2 instance.

Connection draining time can be set anywhere from 1 to 3600 seconds. (Default is 300s or 5 mins).

If our requests are pretty short, we can set the draining connection parameter to very small values , else if it is a longer request, then we want to set it to a higher value, but the tradeoff is that, the instance will still be up and running till the connection is completely drained.
