Load balancers are servers that forward traffic to multiple downstream servers.


#### Why Load Balancer ? 
- Spread load across multiple downstream instances
- Provide single point of access (DNS) to your application
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Provide high availability across zones

### Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- AWS managed Load Balancer
- Very few configuration steps

It costs less to set up own load balancer but will be a huge effort on our end.
Further ELB is integrated with all AWS services to it make much better sense to use it at scale


### Health Checks
- Crucial operation for load balancers
- The health check is done on a defined port and a route ( `/health` is common)
- Response code must be 200
