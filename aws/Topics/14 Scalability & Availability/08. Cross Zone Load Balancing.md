If we have cross zone load balancing enabled, each load balancer will distribute load evenly across all available instances across all availability zones !! When will we need this ?

This can help with improving fault tolerances in globally distributed setup where we have lesser number of load balancers and more number of EC2 instances spread across multiple AZs. 

Some use cases that come to mind: 

**Cost Optimization**: Sometimes, due to reserved instances or spot instance pricing, you might have instances in one AZ that are less expensive than in others. With cross-zone load balancing, you can fully utilize these cost-effective instances even if the traffic originates from another AZ.

**High Availability and Fault Tolerance**: Cross-zone load balancing increases the fault tolerance of your application. If one AZ goes down or experiences issues, the load balancer can route traffic to instances in other AZs, maintaining the availability of your application without any manual intervention.

For ALB 
- by default cross zone load balancing will be enabled, but it can be disabled at the target group level
- for ALB since cross zone LB is enabled by default, there is 
  **no extra charge** on top of it
- But in general transferring data across AZs cost money ( bandwidth and network usage )

For **NLB** and **GWLB**
- Cross zone is disabled by default
- **Paid** if we enable it - costs more

For Classic Load Balancer
- Disabled by default
- **Not charged** if enabled

CLB is suitable for simpler, legacy load balancing needs, ALB and NLB provide more advanced, high-performance options tailored to modern application architectures and specific protocol requirements.
