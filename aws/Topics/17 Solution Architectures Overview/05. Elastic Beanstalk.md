- Provides a **developer centric view** of deploying an application on AWS.
- It is a **Managed service** that **automatically handles** capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, application health monitoring, instance configuration…
- All the developer has to care about is just the application code
- Users still have **full control over the configuration** 
- Beanstalk is free but we have to **pay for the underlying infra**

### Components of Elastic Bean Stalk

- **Application** : This is more like the project - that contains all the components, environments, versions, configs …
- **Application Version** : An iteration of your application code
- **Environment**: Collection of AWS resources that are running an application version ( Only one application version can be run at a time)
	- We have multiple Environment Tiers ( Web Server Env Tier & Worker Environment Tier )
	- We can have multiple environments that we can configure ( dev, test and prod )

### Cloud Formation

Cloud Formation is the service that creates the elastic beanstalk environment behind the scenes. 

Just like how we use terraform to deploy the infra , cloud formation is sort of like the AWS’ internal version of terraform.
