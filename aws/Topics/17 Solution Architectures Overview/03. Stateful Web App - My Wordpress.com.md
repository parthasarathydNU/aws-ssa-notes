- We are trying to create a fully scalable WordPress Website
- Website should be able to correctly capture and display picture uploads
- User data and blog content to be stored in MYSQL database
- Scale Globally

In the current state, we have multi AZ EC2 deployments with RDS having Multi AZ read replicas setup.

However to make this globally and we want easier maintenance, we can switch to the Amazon Aurora service. If needed not necessary.

### Storing Images and Documents

Next to be able to access images and stored data, there are two ways to achieve this. Using EBS or EFS. 

However the problem with EBS is that we can only attach an EBS to one instance at a time. If we do it this way, the image that was uploaded to EBS can only be accessed by the EC2 instance that the EBS is attached to. If a user's request get's redirected to another instance, this data is no longer available. This is an issue.

 To overcome this, we can move to use EFS instead of EBS because, an EFS can be attached to multiple EC2 instances through the ENI at the same time allowing for a shared network file system accessibility.

This way we have set up a system which allows all instances to access the same data irrespective of which AZ they are in

### Summary

In this architecture discussion we saw the following: 
1. Aurora Database to have easy Multi-AZ and Read Replicas
2. Storing data in EBS ( single instance application )
3. Vs storing Data in EFS ( Multi instance application )

One thing to note is that the cost increases as we upgrade our architecture to use advanced features like using EFS in place of EBS, but the important thing is to consider the usability of each feature and how it adds value to the business and drives revenue as compared to the absolute cost of including that feature in the architecture.
