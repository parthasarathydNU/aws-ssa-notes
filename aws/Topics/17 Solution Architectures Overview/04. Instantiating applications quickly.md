### EC2 Instance -

#### Golden AMI
The fastest way to start up EC2 instances is through creating Golden AMI, where we have all the necessary dependencies and packages installed and all that needs to be done is attaching the configuration and starting the image within a VM. 

This way we can quickly spin up as many instances that we need to support our workloads.

#### Bootstrapping User data: 
This way we can attach dynamic configuration during the start time of our application.  In the below example we see how the environment file of the application is dynamically created in the application startup script. This way an application can be quickly spun up in any different environment by just changing the variables for that environment. ![[Pasted image 20240425125034.png]]

#### Elastic Beanstalk - Hybrid
This approaches is a mix of Golden AMI and User Data , we need to look into this later.

### RDS Databases and EBS volumes: 

The fastest way is to instantiate these types of workloads is to **quickly spin up an instance from an existing snapshot.**  This way it is already configured with the data and also the config !
