VPC is a virtual network dedicated to ones AWS account, by default there is one VPC allocated to each account and more can be added later.  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html

VPCs are limited to availability Zones. The default VPC that comes with each AWS account has a public subnet associated with it, an internet gateway and settings to enable DNS resolution. This way we can immediately start launching instances and access the public IP address for simple applications like websites and blog posts.
