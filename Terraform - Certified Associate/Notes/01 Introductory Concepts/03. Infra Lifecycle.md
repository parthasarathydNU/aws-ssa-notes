A number of *clearly defined and distinct work phases* used by DevOps Engineers to **plan, design, build, test, deliver, maintain and retire** cloud infra.

Day 0 - 2 is a way to describe phases of an infra lifecycle.

- Day 0 - Planning and Design <---- IaC starts here
- Day 1 - Developing and Iterating 
- Day 2 - Go live and maintain

### Advantages of using IaC to enhance the infra lifecycle

**Reliability :** No matter how many times you run your IaC, you will always, always, always end up with the same state that is expected. (***Idempotent***)

**Managability :**
- enable versioning of IaC
- manageable mutations
- version control using systems like Git
