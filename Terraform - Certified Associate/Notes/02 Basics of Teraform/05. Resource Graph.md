Terraform builds a **dependency graph** from the Terraform Configurations, and walks this graph to generate plans, refresh state and more. 

The resource graph has multiple types of nodes
1. Resource Node
2. Resource Meta-Node ( Group Node )
3. Provider configuration node ( Probably refers to the entire configuration )
