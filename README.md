## AWS Notes - README

This folder contains notes on various AWS services and functionalities. The notes are intended to be a comprehensive study guide for those preparing for AWS certifications or simply wanting to learn more about AWS.

**Structure:**

* **Topics:** This folder contains individual markdown files for each major AWS service or topic. The files are numbered for easy reference (e.g., 01 Security Groups.md, 15 RDS Aurora + ElastiCache).
    * Subfolders within Topics may contain additional breakdown of specific functionalities within a service.
    * Some topic folders may also contain a "Quiz.md" file with practice questions.
    * Images related to the topic may be found in a folder within the topic directory (e.g., 14 Scalability & Availability/images).
* **ChatGPT Conversations:** This folder contains notes derived from conversations with ChatGPT about specific AWS concepts (e.g., NLB vs NAT vs ALB.md). 
* **Mock Tests:** This folder contains notes and resources related to mock tests, including links, reviews, and a progress tracker (Mock Test Progress.md). Images related to mock tests are stored in a subfolder (images).
* **Images:** This folder contains general purpose images that may not be specific to a single topic.
